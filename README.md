Here is a basic scientific calculator which involves several features like the basic calculations, evaluation of logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and so on.

Further, it includes two themes that is light theme and dark theme which can be switched to and fro using the toggle button.
There is a feature to view the previous calculations as well using the ```HIS``` history button.
Moreover, using the ```Graph``` button one can plot graphs as well.

Clarity about the functionality of trigonometric functions - I have included a ```RAD``` button which toggles between ```RAD``` and ```DEG```. If the screen value is in radians then by clicking on ```DEG``` the angle gets converted into degree while if the screen value is in degree then by clicking on the ```RAD``` button the angle gets converted into radian. 
The sin, cos, tan functions evaluate the value considering the standard condition that is the angle being in radians. Hence, the user is expected to change the angle into radians  with the toggle button before using the trigonometric functions. Also, the toggle button can be used to convert radians to degree and vice versa.
